multi repo helper


## install
Among other things this project depends on (newish) `bash` and `curl`. Having this in mind recommended method of 
installing is to execute latest install script.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoosiba/mrh/master/src/installer.bash | bash
```

### manual
Get latest release form https://github.com/yoosiba/mrh/releases. Download zip and unpack to a desired location.

### no install
You can just `git clone` the source. You will get some obsolete stuff, but project is usable just by 
running `./mrh/src/mrh.bash`.
